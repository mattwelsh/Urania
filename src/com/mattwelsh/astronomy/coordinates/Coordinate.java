/**
 * This class represents an abstract astronomical coordinate. This class exists because typical
 * astronomical coordinates come in several flavors, including right ascension, declination,
 * altitude, and azimuth.
 *
 * <p>Subclasses of this class must implement the reduceToRange() method which ensures the value of
 * the angle represented by the coordinate falls within the correct range, which can vary between
 * implementations. For example, right ascension is usually expressed in hour, minutes, and seconds,
 * which in turn are within the range 0-360 degrees, while declination has a valid range between -90
 * and 90.
 *
 * <p>This class doesn't implement any setters because some subclasses may be designed to be
 * immutable.
