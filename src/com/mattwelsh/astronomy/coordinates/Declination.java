/**
 * This class extends the Coordinate class and implements the reduceToRange method to ensure the
 * angle represented is between -90 to 90 degrees. Below are some examples of the result of calling
 * this method:
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>45 degrees -> 45 degrees
 *   <li>
 *   <li>90 degrees -> 90 degrees
 *   <li>
 *   <li>135 degrees -> 45 degrees
 *   <li>
 *   <li>225 degrees -> -45 degrees
 *   <li>
 *   <li>241.23917 degrees -> -61.23917 degrees
 *   <li>
 *   <li>-517.9103 degrees -> -22.0897 degrees
 *   <li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This translation is similar to how latitude on earth works. You can visualize these
 * translations as if you were moving your finger on a globe. If you start at the equator and move
 * north your latitude increases until you reach the pole, where it then begins to decrease. As you
 * continue moving your finger down you reach zero at the equator and moving still farther south the
 * latitude continues to decrease until you reach the south pole where the latitude is of course -90
 * degrees.
